# oUF_Lua

 oUF_Lua is a unit frame layout using frameworks [oUF-wow](https://github.com/oUF-wow/oUF). It has PvE-orinted features and layout, customized to my personal preferences.

**Updated to [World of Warcraft - Legion](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) (patch 7.3)**

**obs.:** This is a personal project to make interesting and fun to learn [Lua the programming language](http://www.lua.org/) and addon programming.

```
You're free to use it and give any feedback, but I'm not taking any requests.
